<p>Ratan Naval Tata is a tremendous businessman who is also quite involved in social issues. 
    He is a prominent philanthropist in India who supports learning, medical, and agricultural improvement. 
    Tata aided the Faculty of Engineering at the University of New South Wales in developing capacitive deionization to enhance water quality in underserved regions.
     Let's look at a few more such activities done by him.</p>
     <ol class="points">
        <p>1. He had willed a large part of his property for charitable purposes and in 1919 the Sir Ratan Tata Trust was established with a corpus of Rs 80 lakh. Today, Tata Trust exists as one of India's oldest and most respected charity foundations.</p>
        <p>2. In 2010, Tata Group enterprises and Tata charities gave $50 million to Harvard Business School to establish an executives center (HBS). Thus, the name of the executive center is decided to name after Ratan Tata and thus named Tata Hall. For Reminder, it was the same business school from which Ratan Tata previously did his seven weeks Advance Management Program.</p>
        <p>3. TCS Hall, a 48,000 square-foot structure, was built with a $35 million donation from TCS. TCS has made the largest single corporate philanthropy to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) for intelligent systems and automated vehicle research center.</p>
        <p>4. The Tata Education and Development Trust, a charitable component of the Tata Group, has established a $28 million Tata Fundraising Campaign, which will enable Cornell University to offer financial help to Indian undergrads.</p>
        <p>5. The Tata Trusts, led by Ratan Tata, gave a gift of 750 million to the Indian Institute of Science's Centre for Neuroscience to explore the factors that cause Alzheimer's disease.</li>
        <p>6. The Tata Trusts support 11,000+ self-help groups across India, most of them populated by women. Tata companies aren't far behind. The all-women dairy at Maval by Tata Power encourages entrepreneurship among rural women.</p>
